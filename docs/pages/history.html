    <h2>Concordia and its Eastern Necropolis</h2>
    <p>
      The town of Concordia Sagittaria, once the ancient roman colony of <am>Iulia Concordia</am>, is now located in Portogruaro in the north-eastern Italian region of Veneto.
      In 1873, a large necropolis containing around 300 sarcophagi (<em>arcae</em>), one third of which had inscriptions, was discovered on the eastern side of Concordia. The tombs can be dated to between the 3rd and early 5th centuries AD.
      To distinguish this site from the western necropolis, it is known as the Necropoli di Levante (Eastern Necropolis) or the Sepolcreto dei Militi (Soldiers' Graveyard). The latter name derives from the numerous soldier's tombs present in the necropolis, which improve modern knowledge regarding the late Roman army. However, this epithet is misleading, since most of those buried were civilians.
    </p>
    <h3>The ancient colony of <em>Iulia Concordia</em></h3>
    <h2>Origins and Strategic Location</h2>
    <p>
      The ancient <em>Iulia Concordia</em> (today’s Concordia Sagittaria) was a vital hub of <em>Regio X</em> in north-eastern Italy, situated at the intersection of wealthy trade routes linking the Italian peninsula to Central Europe and the Adriatic Sea. The region served as a transit point for Baltic amber coming from Slovenia (Šašel 1974, p. 147) and for gold from the local mines described by Polybius (Srab. 4.6.12).
    </p>
    <p>
      Human presence at the site is recorded since the 10th century BC (Bianchin Citton 2001, 102), but the process of Romanization intensified in the 2nd century BC with the foundation of Aquileia and the intersection of the Via Annia and Via Postumia (Cresci Marrone 2001a, 119). In addition to the roads, the lagoon offered a healthy environment and safe harbors, as demonstrated by the defensive capabilities of the young Paduans against the Spartans described by Titus Livius (Liv. 10.2.4-13).
    </p>
    <h2>Foundation and Etymology</h2>
    <p>
      There is no certain date for its foundation, but the etymology provides valuable clues: Iulia references the imperial family, while Concordia indicates a political reconciliation. The main theories oscillate between the Caesarean era (Scarpa Bonazza, Veronese 1978, 13) and the period following the Second Triumvirate in 43 BC (Zovatto 1973, 1). It is almost certain, however, that the city existed before 27 BC, as colonies founded after that date would have taken the epithet Augusta (Scarpa Bonazza, Veronese 1978, 13).
    </p>
    <h2>Military Role and Decline</h2>
    <p>
      Over the centuries, the city witnessed the passage of imperial troops and barbarian invasions, such as those of the Quadi and Marcomanni, which led to the depopulation of the surrounding countryside (Croce Da Villa 2001b, 204). In the 4th century AD, the city gained particular fame due to its arrow factory (Cresci Marrone 2001b, 247), which was so significant that it gave the city its modern name, "Sagittaria."
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the economic vitality maintained until the beginning of the 5th century thanks to Eastern merchants, the barbarian invasions and the fall of the Western Roman Empire marked the inevitable decline of Concordia, following the fate of nearby Aquileia.
